# Dungeons & Dragons Character Generator

Are you getting tired of doing manually every character? Then this repository is for you.

Autogenerates 100 characters by rolling 4 6-faces dices:

- 6 characteristics: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma
- 3 kind of races: Dwarfs, Elves, Humans
- 3 kinds of classes: Warriors, Wizards, Rangers

### These race bonus rules are used:

- **Humans**: are highly versatile but they don't have any bonus not penalty.
- **Warriors**: they get a +3 bonus in Strength if the race is Dwarf or +2 if it is Human.
- **Wizards**: who get a +1 bonus in Intelligence if the race is Elf or Human.
- **Rangers**: who get a +2 bonus in Dexterity if the race is Elf.

### These characteristics bonus rules are used:
- 16-17 — +3
- 14-15 — +2
- 12-13 — +1
- 10-11 — +0
- 8-9 — -1
- 6-7 — -2
- 4-5 — -3
- Values below 3 and above 18 can be inferred following the same rule.
